**Inota Plus**: A loan management and credit scoring system for farmers.

Inota Plus is an innovative informational website designed using React to assist farmers in obtaining loans without the need for a guarantor. Our platform simplifies the loan application process, allowing farmers to focus on their agricultural activities while we handle the financial aspects. We provide a robust credit scoring system that evaluates farmers' creditworthiness based on their financial behaviors, such as utility payments and income from agricultural activities.

2.Payment Tracker: Monitors repayment dates and durations for loans.
